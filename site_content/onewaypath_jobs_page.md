# JOBS

## Building Communities Means Building Opportunity

We prioritize hiring local, well-paying construction roles and building long-term partnerships with trades. Our model shortens the tender cycle, provides predictable work, and channels investment directly into community crews. By co-planning pipelines with partners, we align project pace and scope with available talent — helping trades grow sustainably while keeping economic benefits within the community.

For us, employment is not a by-product of development. It is a core community outcome.
